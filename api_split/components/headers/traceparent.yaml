  describes the position of the incoming request in its trace graph 

  in a portable, fixed-length format. 

  Its design focuses on fast parsing. 

  Every tracing tool MUST properly set traceparent even when it only relies 

  on vendor-specific information in tracestate.

  The traceparent HTTP header field identifies the incoming request in a tracing
  system. It has four fields:

  - version-format: 2 bytes, "00-"in ASCII

  - trace-id: 32 bytes, a unique identifier for the trace, represented as a
  16-byte array, formatted as a 32-digit hexadecimal number

  - parent-id: 16 bytes, a unique identifier for the span, represented as an
  8-byte array, formatted as a 16-digit hexadecimal number

  - trace-flags: An 8-bit field that controls tracing flags such as sampling,
  trace level, etc
    Example Value = 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01
    base16(version) = 00
    base16(trace-id) = 4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736
    base16(parent-id) = 00f067aa0ba902b7
    base16(trace-flags) = 01  // sampled
