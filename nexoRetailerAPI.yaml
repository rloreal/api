          description: |
              The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
              identify a request. It is used by the service to identify subsequent
              retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behavior by sending
              the same response without executing the request a second time.

              Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key
              may return the same response without further check. Therefore, it is
              recommended to use an UUID version 4 (random) or any other random
              string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

              Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay
              within this limits, if they require idempotent behavior.

              describes the position of the incoming request in its trace graph 
              in a portable, fixed-length format. 
              Its design focuses on fast parsing. 
              Every tracing tool MUST properly set traceparent even when it only relies 
              on vendor-specific information in tracestate.
              The traceparent HTTP header field identifies the incoming request in a tracing system. It has four fields:
              - version-format: 2 bytes, "00-" in ASCII
              - trace-id: 32 bytes, a unique identifier for the trace, represented as a 16-byte array, formatted as a 32-digit hexadecimal number
              - parent-id: 16 bytes, a unique identifier for the span, represented as an 8-byte array, formatted as a 16-digit hexadecimal number
              - trace-flags: An 8-bit field that controls tracing flags such as sampling, trace level, etc
                Example Value = 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01
                base16(version) = 00

                base16(trace-flags) = 01  // sampled
