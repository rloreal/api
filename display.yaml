      *Rules*
      **MinimumDisplayTime**  
        If DisplayOutput.MinimumDisplayTime is greater than zero, the OutputContent content has to be displayed at least this period in seconds, 
        but the message response has to be sent immediately.
        If  a new Display message is sent before the end of this period, 
        the receiver of the message overwrites the current display and send back a Display response with Response.Response = SUCC (”Success”), if a response is required. 
        Any new command requiring a display on the same device could overwrite before the end of the minimum display time.
