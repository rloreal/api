              The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
              identify a request. It is used by the service to identify subsequent
              retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behavior by sending
              the same response without executing the request a second time.

              Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key
              may return the same response without further check. Therefore, it is
              recommended to use an UUID version 4 (random) or any other random
              string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

              Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay
              within this limits, if they require idempotent behavior.

              The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
